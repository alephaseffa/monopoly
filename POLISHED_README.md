## Running the Game

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

### Launch
```bash
# Run the polished version
python3 polished_launcher.py

# Or run directly
python3 gui/polished_monopoly_gui.py
```

## Testing

### Run Code Quality Tests
```bash
python3 tests/test_code_quality.py -v
```

### Run UI Tests (requires tkinter)
```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_monopoly_ui -v
```

## Design Decisions

### Color Palette
- Used official Monopoly property colors from Hasbro specifications
- Created a warm, inviting UI color scheme

### Layout
- Board takes center stage with maximum visibility
- Side panel for game controls and information
- Scrollable panel area for smaller screens
- Fixed aspect ratio to maintain board proportions

### Typography
- Classic serif font for Monopoly branding
- Clean sans-serif for UI elements
- Monospace font for game log
- Appropriate font sizes for hierarchy

### Animations
- 400ms per space token movement for visibility
- 1500ms dice roll animation for excitement
- Smooth hover and click feedback
- No jarring transitions

## Code Architecture

### Separation of Concerns
- `colors.py`: All visual constants and theme definitions
- `authentic_board.py`: Board rendering and token management
- `polished_panels.py`: Individual UI component classes
- `polished_monopoly_gui.py`: Main application orchestration
- `game_controller.py`: Game logic and state management

### Design Patterns
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of model, view, and controller
- **Observer Pattern**: Callbacks for game events
- **Factory Pattern**: Component creation methods
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single game instance management

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient canvas rendering with minimal redraws
- Lazy loading of UI components
- Optimized animation frames
- Memory-efficient token management

## Accessibility Features
- High contrast colors for readability
- Clear visual indicators for game state
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Keyboard navigation support (planned)

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Save/Load game functionality
- [ ] Network multiplayer support
- [ ] Advanced AI strategies
- [ ] Custom board themes
- [ ] Sound effects and music
- [ ] Tournament mode
- [ ] Statistics tracking
